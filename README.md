# weather-app

A simple weather application built with HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript, and integrated with jQuery for enhanced functionality.

## Features

- Fetches current weather and a 7-day forecast for a specified city.
- Displays weather details including temperature, description, sunrise, sunset, wind speed, humidity, and more.
- Dynamically updates the UI with weather icons and data.

## What I Learned

- **DOM Manipulation with JavaScript and jQuery:** Improved my skills in manipulating the DOM to display data fetched from an API.
- **SCSS for Better Styling:** Used SCSS to create more modular and maintainable styles for the application.
